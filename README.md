## Overview
This project analyzes reported shark attack incidents from 1900 to recent years. The goal is to understand when, where, and how shark attacks occur, identify common patterns, and provide insights that can help improve safety awareness and decision-making. The analysis focuses on trends over time, high-risk locations, activities, shark species involved, time of day, and injury outcomes.
## Tools Used and Analysis Process
The analysis was carried out using Power BI, applying the following tools and techniques as required by the project instructions:
-	Power Query was used to clean and transform the raw dataset. This included removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing text fields (such as species, injury type, and time), and creating new categorized columns.
-	Data Cleaning involved fixing inconsistent entries, grouping similar values, and replacing null or unclear data with meaningful categories such as “Unknown” where appropriate.
-	Data Modeling was implemented using a star schema, with a central fact table (Shark Attacks) and supporting dimension tables (Date, Country, Species, Time Period, and Injury Type). This improved performance and ensured accurate analysis.
-	DAX Measures were created to calculate total attacks, fatal attacks, fatality rate, number of countries, and number of shark species.
-	Data Visualization techniques were applied to clearly present trends, comparisons, and distributions through charts, maps, and KPIs.
This structured approach ensured the data was reliable and suitable for analysis before insights were generated.
## Key Findings and Visual Explanations
### Shark Attacks Over Time
The number of reported shark attacks shows a general increase over time, especially from the 1990s onward.
### Countries with the Most Shark Attacks
A small number of countries account for most shark attacks. The United States and Australia report the highest number of incidents, mainly in popular coastal and recreational areas.
### Shark Attacks by Activity Type
Surfing and swimming are the most common activities during which shark attacks occur. These activities increase the amount of time people spend in the water, raising exposure risk.
### Shark Attacks by Time of Day
Most shark attacks occur during the afternoon and morning periods, when ocean activity is highest. Attacks at night are rare.
### Shark Attacks by Injury Types
Injuries most commonly affect the legs and arms. This is consistent with the way sharks interact with humans during water activities.
### Shark Species Involved
A small group of shark species is responsible for most recorded attacks. Great White, Tiger, and Bull sharks appear most frequently in the data.

## Recommendations 
-	Public Awareness: Increase safety education in high-risk countries, especially for surfers and swimmers.
-	Time-Based Safety Measures: Encourage caution during peak attack times such as morning and afternoon hours.
-	Targeted Monitoring: Focus shark monitoring and warning systems in identified hotspots rather than applying broad global measures.
-	Activity Guidelines: Promote safety guidelines for high-risk activities, including surfing zones and swimming advisories.
-	Improved Data Collection: Continue improving data recording to reduce the number of unknown or missing values in future reports.
## Conclusion
This analysis provides a clear view of global shark attack patterns using cleaned and well-structured data. By combining historical trends with activity, location, and species information, the findings support better understanding of shark-related risks and help guide practical safety decisions.
